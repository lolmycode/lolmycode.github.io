   happy, but
   <br>
   slightly disappointed
   <br>
   <br>

   ok, but
   <br>
   not great
   <br>
   <br>

   very good, but
   <br>
   not perfect
   <br>
   <br>

   soft, but
   <br>
   not the softest
   <br>
   <br>

   nice, but
   <br>
   not the color pictured
   <br>
   <br>

   capable, but
   <br>
   underpowered
   <br>
   <br>

   functional, but
   <br>
   flimsy
   <br>
   <br>

   disappointing, but
   <br>
   will do
   <br>
   <br>

   nice, but
   <br>
   extremely lightweight
   <br>
   <br>

   versatile, but
   <br>
   not sure if practical
   <br>
   <br>

   good plastic, but
   <br>
   ndon't look at them up close
   <br>
   <br>

   fine, but
   <br>
   no instructions
   <br>
   <br>

   butt-ugly, but
   <br>
   a good blanket
   <br>
   <br>

   fine, but
   <br>
   nothing out-of-the-norm
   <br>
   <br>

  beautiful, but
   <br>
  ultimately too loud
   <br>
   <br>

  pretty, but
  <br>
  stanky
  <br>
  <br>

   attractive, but
   <br>
   won't withstand desert heat
   <br>
   <br>

   attractive, but
   <br>
   a little small and a little flimsy
   <br>
   <br>

  very very tiny, but
   <br>
  still cute
   <br>
   <br>

   large, but
    <br>
   not obnoxious
    <br>
    <br>

  stiff, but
  <br>
  good
  <br>
  <br>

  good, but
  <br>
  not wonderful
  <br>
  <br>

    great for a desk, but
     <br>
    not ideal for a nightstand
     <br>
     <br>

    uncomfortable to use, but
      <br>
    it gets the job done
      <br>
      <br>

    gets the job done, but
    <br>
    is aggravating
    <br>
    <br>

   great quality, but
    <br>
   seamess unwound quickly
    <br>
    <br>

   came with stains, but
     <br>
   still a nice blanket
     <br>
     <br>

  most definitely a hospital blanket, but
  <br>
  that's okay
  <br>
  <br>

  looks real from afar, but
  <br>
  smelt weird when it first arrived
  <br>
  <br>

  I have no problem with the broom, but
  <br>
  the dustpan is awful
  <br>
  <br>

  nice light switch, but
  <br>
  not luxurious looking in person
  <br>
  <br>

  doorbell is beautiful, but
  <br>
  screws are rubbish
  <br>
  <br>

  functions as a container, but
  <br>
  doesn't look great while doing it
  <br>
  <br>

  surpassed my expectations, but
  <br>
  is still just ok
  <br>
  <br>

  okay, but
  <br>
  you can do better
  <br>
  <br>

  doesn’t sit completely flat, but
  <br>
  not in a way that causes issues
  <br>
  <br>

  looks good, but
  <br>
  has flaws
  <br>
  <br>

  nice, but
  <br>
  a little delicate
  <br>
  <br>

  nice, but
  <br>
  not something i use all the time
  <br>
  <br>

  pretty colors, but
  <br>
  questionable packaging
  <br>
  <br>

  cheaply made, but
  <br>
  works
  <br>
  <br>

  works, but
  <br>
  can be annoying
  <br>
  <br>

  i like it, but
  <br>
  i struggle to love it
  <br>
  <br>

  a bit clunky, but
  <br>
  great if you want a weighted rope
  <br>
  <br>

  wasn’t exactly what I expected, but
  <br>
  i like it
  <br>
  <br>

  serves its purpose, but
  <br>
  there is better out there
  <br>
  <br>

  nice, but
  <br>
  not my idea of teal
  <br>
  <br>

  not worth returning, but
  <br>
  not good enough to rave about
  <br>
  <br>

  not amazing, but
  <br>
  acceptable
  <br>
  <br>

  not bad, but
  <br>
  not my favorite
  <br>
  <br>

  not remarkable, but
  <br>
  they are just what I needed
  <br>
  <br>

  good, but
  <br>
  doesn't hold up
  <br>
  <br>

  good, but
  <br>
  doesn't hold up
  <br>
  <br>

  good pillow, but
  <br>
  with significant drawbacks
  <br>
  <br>

 surpassed my expectations, but
 <br>
 is still just ok
 <br>
